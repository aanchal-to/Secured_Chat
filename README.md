With the advancement of computing environments, there is an immense need to protect them as well. We all know that today most people have accounts on Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, 
and other means of social media, but the question at the same time arises: how secure is our personal information on these social media sites? In order to protect ourselves from 
for any kind of unauthorized or malicious attack, we need to protect our data as much as we can. For data protection, we need to encrypt it.
Encryption manages the security of information over a specific network. In the ongoing world, there are numerous applications that assist with moving data and information over various systems,
which consequently urges us to think about the security of our information.
Encryption is the process of changing information in such a way as to make it unreadable by anyone except those possessing special knowledge (usually referred to as a "key") that 
allows them to change the information back to its original, readable form.
